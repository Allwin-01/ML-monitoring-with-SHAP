Real-Time ML Monitoring with SHAP
This repository contains a simple, yet complete, machine learning project that showcases a full workflow from model training to real-time logging and interpretability. The project is built around the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset and uses a Random Forest Classifier for classification.

The key components of this project are:

Model Training: A script to train a Random Forest model and save it for future use.

Real-Time Logging: A script that simulates real-time predictions and logs each prediction's details, including runtime, to a CSV file.

Model Interpretability: A script that uses the SHAP library to provide a detailed explanation of why the model made a specific prediction.

This project is a great example of how to build a deployable and understandable machine learning system.
